    <h1 class="header">Season 7</h1>
       
    <p>The Legends have saved the Earth from an alien invasion in 1925, 
    <br>so they thought they could go home and relax. Too bad their time travel ship, 
    <br>the Waverider, was blown up by a second Waverider...
    <br>so now they're trapped in 1925 Odessa, Texas! Only way to get back home and 
    <br>get revenge on their mysterious new enemy is to journey to New York City 
    <br>and find the inventor of the Waverider, Welsh Dr. Gwyn Davies. But with no Waverider, 
    <br>no way to know how they're impacting the timeline, and a time traveling foe, 
    <br>it might be impossible. Along the way, they meet a surprising new teammate: 
    <br>a human Gideon, whose knowledge of the timeline may provide the answer 
    <br>to all of the Legends' problems.</p>
    
   <h1 class="header">Characters</h1> 

   <p>Constantine and Mick leave and in there place comes Gwyn Davies and Human Gideon. 
    <br>Gideon who was previously the waverider's A.I. is now human. 
    <br>There's no real main antagonist this season,
    <br>but they do meet robot versions of themselves.</p>
