    <p>After spending the previous season attempting to locate the 
    <br>Loom of Fate in order to resurrect their murdered friends, 
    <br>the Legends must now defend history from an adversary unlike 
    <br>any they've faced in the past or future. They've battled with monsters, 
    <br>temporal anomalies, and, most recently, former villains, 
    <br>but this season they'll confront something much more difficult and odd... 
    <br>space aliens! After one of their own is kidnapped by a violent 
    <br>extraterrestrial, this new mission takes on new meaning. 
    <br>It will require more than the Legends' combined abilities. 
    <br>They must find a new Legend, a lady who was taken by aliens 
    <br>as a youngster and is said to be endowed with talents that would 
    <br>aid the squad in defeating their cosmic foes.</p>
    
   <h1 class="header">Characters</h1> 

   <p>Ray, Nora, Mona, and Charlie all depart. 
     <br>The Legends recruit a new member with special abilities. 
     <br>The new foes are out of this world!</p>
